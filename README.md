# Hire-Here-College-project
The ‘Hire Here’ is based on web application that is used for providing 
part time jobs for seekers. The aim of the project is to automate the work 
performed in the part-time job. A part-time job is a form of employment that 
carries fewer hours than a full time job. Nearly one in ten professionals now 
work part-time. Not only professional’s, students also seek for part-time jobs. 
With the maintenance loan often falling to cover the cost of living, more and 
more students are being forced to get a part-time job to simply get by. More 
than half students who work part-time spend their additional income on 
necessities such as accommodation, food and household bills. A part-time job 
can have many positive impact on our life. Such as money, budgeting, time 
management etc. There are so many trusted sites for online part-time job. You 
can register for free and provide your service information. Part time job 
seekers are enrolled on a first-come, first served basis. While applying for a 
part-time job the job seekers must complete the application form by providing 
necessary information about them. The details about the job vacancies are 
advertised by the job providers or specific companies. Customers have a major 
role in the system.
